	Based on the average weight of this breed, the National Research Council of the National Academies recommends between 989 and 1,272 calories daily for sedentary golden retrievers and between 1,353 and 1,740 calories per day for active dogs.  Older retrievers suffering from joint problems typically require fewer calories than their younger, more active counterparts.  Golden Retrievers generally range in weight between 55 and 75 pounds.

	When combining foods, compute the caloric content of the combined foods from information on the labels, to ensure you hold to your dog's recommended daily calories.  Dry kibble helps to keep your Golden Retriever's teeth clean of tartar by scraping the surface of the teeth. Canned food provides additional moisture in your dog's diet and can be mixed with dry food to entice your dog with its aroma, if your Golden Retriever needs it.  To ensure your golden retriever will receive a proper balance of all the nutrients and vitamins required to thrive consider commercial dog foods labeled "complete and balanced".  This meets the standards for a nutritious diet as established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

	However, some dog owners prefer to feed homemade diets to their dogs. It is important to consult your veterinarian or a canine nutrition expert to ensure what you feed provides all the nutrients in the proper balance for your dog's health. Check with your veterinarian before feeding your dog raw meat.
