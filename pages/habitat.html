	If your new Golden is still a puppy, don’t be surprised if he isn’t a little homesick at first. To ease some of this homesickness, try placing a fluffy towel in the dryer for a couple of minutes, just so it is toasty, and putting it in the bed or crate with your puppy. This often makes him feel more at ease until he has time to warm up to his new environment.  After all, he is being taken from his mom and his siblings, and brought into this new, strange home, with people he doesn’t know.

	There are many different types of puppy beds for sale in your local pet supply store, but in many cases, these are quite expensive.  Keep in mind when you are purchasing bedding for your Golden, that they love to chew, on virtually everything, so that whatever you buy, you will likely have to replace at some point in the near future, especially if your Golden is still a puppy. You want to choose bedding that is made of a durable material, wool seems to work well, as it is pretty tough, provides adequate heat, and can absorb moisture, in case your Golden should have an accident. You can save money by using an old blanket, either one that you may already have at home. Just remember to wash it before allowing your Golden to use it, especially if it is one that you purchased from your local thrift or Goodwill store.
