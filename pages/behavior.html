	Golden Retrievers are a social breed of dog.  They adore people and thrive on companionship.  Consequently, if left alone too long, especially without proper exercise, Golden Retrievers can develop Separation Anxiety which usually means destructive chewing. Ironically, well-adjusted Golden Retrievers are big chewers without anxiety; hence, they must be provided with plenty of their own chew toys and bones, unless you donâ€™t mind sharing your shoes, books, pillows and other household items with them.

	Golden Retrievers are, for the most part, even-tempered and well behaved.  However, potential owners should do their research before resolving with a breeder.  As this breed of dog is popular, it has led to unfortunate indiscriminate breeding practices.  This may lead to puppies with unstable temperaments.  All the exercise and socialization in the world can't undo a bad bloodline, so always adopt from a reputable breeder.
