	In 1913, Golden Retrievers were recognized in their own right as “Retrievers – Yellow or Golden.”  Golden Retrievers remained largely unknown until 1904, when one of the Marjoribanks dogs won the first field trial for retrievers. “Yellow retrievers” were registered thereafter with The Kennel Club (of England) as “Retrievers – Wavy or Flat-Coated” and were shown for the first time in 1908, in a class for “Flat-Coats of Any Other Color.”

	The American Kennel Club registered its first Golden Retriever in 1925.  Golden Retrievers first came to the United States in the early 1900s and immediately became popular. The most notable foundation sire, Am/Can Ch Speedwell Pluto, was born in England in 1929 and made enormous contributions to the breed worldwide.  The Golden Retriever Club of America was founded in 1938 and is one of the strongest AKC parent clubs.  Golden Retrievers grew steadily in popularity in the United States both before and after World War II, with a surge in registration in the 1970s. Golden Retrievers are used as hunting dogs, assistance and service dogs, guide dogs for the blind, search-and-rescue dogs and as tracking and scenting specialists. The Golden Retriever’s grace, trainability and delightful temperament contribute to the breed’s popularity as a family companion. They usually are among the top ten most popular breeds in AKC registrations.  They excel in obedience trials, hunting tests, field trials and agility, as well as in the conformation show ring.
